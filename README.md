## **Aim**
To demonstrate the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and advanced simulation techniques in creating a high-fidelity, high-definition (HD) educational tutorial for a complex open-heart surgical procedure, accurately depicting anatomical structures, specialized instrumentation, and critical procedural steps for the benefit of junior residents and medical students.

## **Procedure**

### **1. Data Acquisition and Curation (The Knowledge Base)**

**Source Data:**  
AI models are trained on an extensive, multi-modal dataset including:
- De-identified, high-resolution 4K surgical video footage (annotated by senior surgeons)  
- Pre-operative imaging (CT, MRI, 3D Echocardiography)  
- 3D anatomical models (segmented from patient data)  
- Textual surgical atlases and operative reports

**Anatomical Segmentation:**  
Deep Learning models such as **U-Net** or **GANs** are used to segment and label critical cardiac and mediastinal structures (e.g., ascending aorta, coronary arteries, right atrium, pericardium) from imaging data with pixel-level precision — forming the basis of the **3D digital twin**.

### **2. Generative Model Selection and Training (The Engine)**

**Procedural Knowledge Model:**  
A large, medical-specific Generative AI model is fine-tuned on the curated dataset.  
It learns:
- Sequential logic  
- Timing  
- Instrument–tissue interaction patterns of the target surgery  

**Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) Integration:**  
The model is coupled with a **real-time Soft-Body Physics Engine** (e.g., based on the **Finite Element Method – FEM**) to accurately simulate:
- Tissue biomechanics (myocardium, vessels, fat)  
- Cutting and suturing responses  
- Realistic visual and mechanical feedback  

---

### **3. Prompt Engineering and Simulation Generation (The Instructional Command)**

**Example Procedural Prompt:**
- **Procedure:** Standard Median Sternotomy for *Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR)*  
- **Anatomy:** Adult patient, bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, Type I arch  
- **Instruments:** Lebsche knife/saw, sternal retractor, aortic cross-clamp, cardioplegia needle, 4-0 Prolene on non-coring needle  
- **Technique:** Emphasis on precise cannulation sites (ascending aorta, right atrium) and the placement of the transverse aortotomy incision relative to the right coronary artery ostium  

**High-Definition Rendering:**  
The Generative Model synthesizes a **4K HD video simulation**, incorporating:
- Accurate lighting and reflections  
- Realistic fluid dynamics (blood management)  
- True-to-life tissue coloration  
- Physically based rendering using the PBR model

### **4. Expert Validation and Iterative Refinement (Quality Control)**

**Clinical Review:**  
Generated tutorials are reviewed by a panel of experienced cardiac surgeons for:
- Anatomical Accuracy  
- Procedural Fidelity (sequence and technique)  
- Instrument Handling realism  

**Feedback Loop:**  
Any discrepancies (e.g., incorrect cannula placement, unrealistic tissue behavior) are annotated and fed back to retrain the model, ensuring improved accuracy and educational quality in subsequent generations.

## **Instructions for Users**

1. **Observe Closely:**  
   Focus on the on-screen display showing the correct instrument name and current function in real-time — provided by AI’s instrument tracking and labeling algorithms.

2. **Analyze Biomechanics:**  
   Note tissue deformation during:
   - Sternal saw application  
   - Cross-clamp placement  
   - Leaflet excision and suturing
   -

3. **Trace the Steps:**  
   Follow the embedded **Procedural Step Guidance overlay**, which:
   - Tracks surgical flow  
   - Highlights the next required action  
   - Provides automated, objective procedural guidance superior to static videos

  Displays anatomical labels (Annulus, Coronary Ostia) and dynamically tracks the instrument in use and procedural step.  

- **3D Rotational Model:**  
  A pre-operative digital twin of the heart, generated from imaging, showcasing the pathology (bicuspid valve) and surgical access points.  

- **Procedural Checklist / Flowchart:**  
  An auto-generated list of critical actions and potential complication alerts based on AI predictive risk models.

## **Result**
The integration of **Generative AI** with **advanced physical modeling** marks a transformative step in surgical education.  
This AI-driven simulation achieves:
- Clinical accuracy in anatomy and technique  
- Precise depiction of surgical instruments  
- Objective, real-time step tracking  

It enables residents to repeatedly practice and internalize complex cardiac procedures in a **risk-free, scalable, and high-fidelity environment**, ensuring a more standardized and proficient future surgical workforce.
